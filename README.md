Hello everyone !

To obtain this project you must:

1. Have your MongoDB credentials and put them in the folder: models / connection.js, inside:
const KEY_DB = 'Your password';
const NAME_DB = 'Your userName';

2. Obtain a key for the API: https://newsapi.org/, it is free locally but impossible to deploy your app with this API because it is paid.
And put this key in the file: frontEnd / components / ScreenSource.js instead of:
  const APIKEY = 'Your KEY';

3. With your terminal:
Go to 'backend' => npm install.
Go to 'frontEnd' => npm install.

4. Then:
1. Go to 'backend' => npm start.
2. Go to 'frontEnd' => npm start.

Enjoy !! :-)
